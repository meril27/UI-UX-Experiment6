# UI-UX-Experiment6

To disign ideation, user stories, scenarios, flow diagrams, and information architecture, with tools like Figma for visualization and design.

## Aim:

To design and prototype a user-friendly solution for booking appointments in a hospital app using UX methodologies such as ideation, user stories, scenarios, flow diagrams, and information architecture, with tools like Figma for visualization and design.

## Algorithm:
Step 1: Problem Definition Identify a known UX problem: e.g., “Booking a doctor’s appointment is confusing for some users.”

Step 2: Solution Ideation (Crazy 8s / Brainwriting) Open Figma or FigJam Create a frame divided into 8 boxes (2x4 grid) Set a timer for 8 minutes Sketch 8 different ideas (1 per box) for solving the problem Use basic shapes and text (low-fidelity wireframes).

Step 3: Create User Stories Define at least 3–5 personas (elderly, working professionals, students, doctors) For each, write user stories using: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]. Use sticky notes or frames in Figma to display each story.

Step 4: Build Narrative Scenarios Pick a user story.

```
Describe:
    The user
    Their environment
    Their emotional state
    Tasks they’re trying to complete
    Represent using sticky notes, illustrations, or storyboards in Figma
```

Step 5: Create User Flow / Task Flow Diagram Choose a task (e.g., “Book appointment”) Use standard flowchart shapes: Start/End (Oval) Process/Action (Rectangle) Decision (Diamond) Connect the steps using arrows Design this using shapes and connectors in Figma.

Step 6: Build Information Architecture (IA) Choose an app/site (e.g., Saveetha University) Perform open or closed card sorting Categorize and list out all sections (Home, Courses, Admissions, About Us, etc.) Create a site map using hierarchy boxes and lines in Figma.
